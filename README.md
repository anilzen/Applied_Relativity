# Applied Relativity

The term "Applied Relativity" appeared first as the title of a book review by [Sciama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_W._Sciama) in 1973 during the [golden age of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_general_relativity#Golden_age). His review of [Weinberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Weinberg)'s book about general relativity mentions the term "engineering relativity," but the context is not engineering; it's astrophysics and cosmology. The golden era is when relativistic astrophysics was born to explain discoveries such as quasars, pulsars, and neutron stars. It was a time of renewed interest in relativity, and people were excited to apply it to relativistic problems. 

Today, relativity stands firm within the astrophysical and cosmological scientific communities. Gravitational-wave astronomy opened the proverbial window to the universe, and we even have pictures of event horizons. 

In this new golden era, applied relativity refers to applying relativity to problems beyond its accepted domains. I'm looking for examples of relativistic techniques in problems where relativistic effects are negligible. These include typical engineering and technology problems with low characteristic speeds and weak gravitational forces.

Do they exist? Read on.
